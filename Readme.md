## About
Microsoft Graph connectors SDK helps you build custom connectors for your line of business data sources quickly and efficiently in any of [11 available languages](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/ "11 available languages"). You can leverage the capabilities of our robust Graph connector agent for indexing any of your cloud or on-prem data sources. The SDK also gives you the capability to manage your custom as well as Microsoft's connectors included with the admin center, all in one place through the Microsoft 365 admin center. Access our full documentation from [Connectors SDK overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/custom-connector-sdk-overview).

## Graph Connector Agent
This lightweight app is the platform that takes care of orchestration capabilities and coordinates between Microsoft 365 admin center and customer's connector code. More on the software: [Graph Connector Agent | Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftSearch/graph-connector-agent "Graph Connector Agent | Microsoft Docs").

## Get Started
1. Install GCA and follow the instructions to register the agent [Graph Connector Agent | Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftSearch/graph-connector-agent "Graph Connector Agent | Microsoft Docs").
2. Download the protocol buffer files with [gRPC contracts](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-connectors-sdk/tree/main/Contracts "gRPC contracts").
3. Protobuf compiler downloaded and extracted from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.19.4/protoc-3.19.4-win64.zip "here") (Not needed if using Visual Studio).
	- Environment path updated with bin folder in extracted root.
	- Compile contracts to create server-side stubs in the language of your choice. More info [here](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/ "11 available languages").
4. Create a project in your IDE and place all the proto files in a folder named "Contracts". Sample project structure here:

5. Implement methods in the stubs generated by the compiler.
6. Create a server, run the application and generate the executable/output binaries.
7. Edit the CustomConnectorPortMap JSON file in the GCA installation folder (Program files > Graph connector agent) with connector id (same as provider id) and TCP port information (port on which you are running the server).
	- You may need to open notepad/VS in admin mode to edit the JSON.
8. Test the connector code via TestApp.
9. Create a custom connector connection on Microsoft Admin Center.
